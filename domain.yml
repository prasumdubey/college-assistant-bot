        I'm sorry, I didnâ€™t quite understand that. Here's what I can help you with:
        - Information on departments (e.g., "Tell me about the Computer Engineering department")
        - Course lists (e.g., "What courses does Civil Engineering offer?")
        - Fee details (e.g., "What's the fee for B.Tech - Computer Engineering?")
        Could you please clarify?
